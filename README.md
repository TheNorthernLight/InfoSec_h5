## x) Read and summarize (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like) â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)


### Choosing an Algorithm:

People have several alternatives to choose an algorithm including published algorithm, trusting a manufacturer, private consultant, government or writing their own algorithm.
The first alternative seems to be the most sensible because trusting a single source is problematic.
The algorithms in the book are public and have been cryptanalyzed by experts in the field.
The abilities of military cryptanalysis organizations are unknown, so it is possible that these algorithms are easier to break than it appears.
A good assumption is that the NSA can read any message that it chooses, but that it cannot read all messages that it chooses.
The best most of us can do is to choose among public algorithms that have withstood a reasonable amount of public scrutiny and cryptanalysis.

### Algorithms for Export:

Algorithms for export out of the United States must be approved by the U.S. government.
It is widely believed that these export-approved algorithms can be broken by the NSA.
The NSA is rumored to privately suggest deliberate weaknesses to companies wishing to export their cryptographic products.
Beware if you buy a U.S. encryption product that has been approved for export.



## y) Choose a password manager. Explain: (This subtask y does not require tests with a computer if the question can be answered without them)

### What treaths does it protect against?

### What information is encrypted, what's not?

### What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?

### Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?

### How is the data protected?


## a) Demonstrate the use of a password manager.


## b) Encrypt and decrypt a message (you can use any tool you want, gpg is one option)


## c) Voluntary bonus: send and receive encrypted message over email.


## e) Voluntary bonus, easy: try rot13, the military grade top-secret encryption of the top-2 empire of year zero. Could double rot13 provide extra security?
